<p>Linux Commands:</p>

<p> 1) The ls command - the list command - functions in the Linux terminal to show all of the major directories filed under a given file system.</p>
<p> 2) The cd command - change directory - will allow the user to change between file directories. As the name command name suggest, you would use the cd command to circulate between two different directories. 
<p> 3) The mv command - move - allows a user to move a file to another folder or directory.
<p> 4) The man command - the manual command - is used to show the manual of the inputted command. Just like a film on the nature of film, the man command is the meta command of the Linux CLI. Inputting the man command will show you all information about the command you are using. 
<p> 5) The mkdir - make directory - command allows the user to make a new directory. 
<p> 6) The rmdir - remove directory - command allows the user to remove an existing command using the Linux CLI.
<p> 7) The touch command - a.k.a. the make file command - allows users to make files using the Linux CLI. Just as the mkdir command makes directories, the touch command makes files.
<p> 8) The rm command - remove - like the rmdir command is meant to remove files from your Linux OS. Whereas the rmdir command will remove directories and files held within, the rm command will delete created files
<p> 9) The locate - a.k.a. find - command is meant to find a file within the Linux OS. If you don't know the name of a certain file or you aren't sure where the file is saved and stored, the locate command comes in handy. 
<p> 10) The clear command - The clear command does exactly what it says. When your Linux CLI gets all mucked up with various readouts and information, the clear command clears the screen and wipes the board clean. Using the clear command will take the user back to the start prompt of whatever directory you are currently operating in. To use the clear command simply type clear.
